# Commands entered to get the orange button to turn green:

# Clone the repo and 'cd' into it
$ git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/scaling-exercise.git
$ cd scaling-exercise

# Run the project and scale the 'compute' service so it runs 3 instances of it.
# One instance is not fast enough to do the calculations in time.
$ docker-compose up --scale compute=3

# Open localhost:3000 in a browser and click the orange button. It should now
# turn green.
